    <h1>About</h1>
    <p class="about-info">Hi, I'm Kailah Korsh, a full stack web developer. Here's a little more about me.
        <br><br>
        After growing up in Boston, I fled harsh winters for the University of California, Santa Barbara where I studied
        Sociology and Ethnomusicology. I loved examining music as a social process within the cultural context it was
        made and became fascinated by the power that music in popular culture has to spread messages and awareness about
        social issues. It was also in Santa Barbara where I began my career working in the music business. I booked sold
        out shows, coordinated concerts and a music festival, all featuring current and up-and-coming artists (e.g.
        Clairo, Young Thug, Aminé, Peach Pit).
<br><br>
        Upon graduating, I moved to LA and worked in artist management where I assisted the managers of a number of high
        profile touring musicians such as Harry Styles, Nicki Minaj, Ava Max, more. I noticed how artists of varying
        magnitudes are able to leverage their influence to not only to continue to propel their career forward, but
        also, if they choose, to create a positive social impact. In the thick of 2020, I witnessed and helped artist’s
        teams navigate overwhelming societal issues and was drawn towards the intersection of influence and impact.
<br><br>
        I transitioned to a role at celebrity-focused venture advisory firm, PLUS Capital, where the team works closely
        with artists and athletes to facilitate partnerships between them and mission-driven companies where there is an
        aligned vision to inspire change. At PLUS, I learned how to work on a small team in a fast-paced environment
        where everyone is equally as collaborative as they are independent and self-reliant. I was exposed to the world
        of startups and learned about companies that are using technology to innovatively approach topics I am
        passionate about, such as sustainability, mental health, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and the future of
        work and education.

        As it turns out, what I really want to do is work on that technology. Throughout my career, I have learned a lot
        about my skill set as well as what kind of working environment and role I thrive in. I am extremely logic-driven
        and organized, and also curious, creative, and intuitive. I flourish in a more structured environment where I
        can be relied on to follow guidelines, creatively problem solve, and ultimately pull my weight by contributing
        to a shared goal. I was craving a different kind of professional experience than what I had been exposed to thus
        far.
<br><br>
        I started using online resources to learn to code and found myself enthralled, challenged, and energized by the
        material. I began to feel more like myself than I had in a long time, allowing both the logical and creative
        parts of my brain to not only coexist but empower one another. I completed General Assembly’s 12 week Software
        Engineering Immersive program with flying colors, and I am now ready to dive into a career that works for me as
        much as I work for it. Web development allows me to build things, contribute to a collaborative objective,
        follow and rely on foundational guidelines, challenge myself and learn with the support of a team. It fulfills
        me in a way that I have not experienced before, and it is the best way for me to contribute to a purpose that I
        believe in.
